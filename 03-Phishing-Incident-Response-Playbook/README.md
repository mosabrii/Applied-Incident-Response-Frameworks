# Phishing Incident Response Playbook

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world phishing incident response scenario from a **SOC Level 1** perspective.  
It focuses on handling a phishing alert involving a malicious email attachment and follows an organization’s incident response playbook to investigate, assess, and resolve the alert.

The project emphasizes **structured incident handling**, decision-making, and proper documentation rather than technical exploitation.

## Scenario

After opening the file, suspicious activity is detected on the endpoint, triggering a security alert that is escalated to the Security Operations Center (SOC).
