# Applied Incident Response Frameworks

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of applied cybersecurity based on realistic and practical security scenarios.
Each project focuses on analyzing a security incident, identifying its root cause and impact, and documenting structured response actions using recognized incident response and security governance practices.

---

## Scope of Content
Projects in this repository may include, but are not limited to:

- Application of internationally recognized security frameworks  
  such as **NIST**, **ISO/IEC**, and similar models
- Cybersecurity incident analysis and investigation  
- Network, application, and infrastructure security incidents  
- Identification of attack types and affected systems  
- Incident response lifecycle activities (analysis, response, recovery)  
- Detection and monitoring improvements  
- Security controls, procedures, and policy alignment

## Repository Structure 
Most projects in this repository typically include:

- **Incident Summary** – a high-level overview of what happened  
- **Incident Report** – detailed technical and operational analysis  
- **Evidence** – supporting artifacts such as logs, traffic captures, or documentation  

However, the exact structure may vary depending on the scenario and project requirements.  
Some projects may focus more on analysis and documentation, while others may include response planning or recovery strategies.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a structured and professional approach to cybersecurity incident response.

It reflects how security incidents are analyzed, documented, and managed within organizational, regulatory, and operational security environments.
