# IOC Mapping

## Overview
This file documents the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) identified during the malware investigation.
The IOCs were extracted from VirusTotal reports and sandbox analysis and mapped to the Pyramid of Pain.

---

## Hash Indicators
The following file hashes were confirmed as malicious by multiple security vendors:

- **SHA-1:**  
  8090744036113b56947702f741584e0365773220

- **MD5:**  
  eb96d1d40807b55977a4563a6f9f38f1

Hash-based IOCs provide basic detection but are easy for attackers to change.

---

## Network Indicators (IP Addresses)
The malware communicated with external IP addresses after execution:

- **Malicious IP:**  
  147.92.114.156

This IP was previously reported by the security community and indicates possible C2 communication.

---

## Domain Indicators
A malicious domain was identified during the investigation:

- **Domain:**  
  clinic.plpms.com

This domain was reported multiple times by VirusTotal users and represents a higher-value IOC.

---

## Additional Network Artifacts
Sandbox analysis revealed extensive network activity, including:

- HTTP requests
- DNS queries
- Multiple IP connections
- Unauthorized process creation

These behaviors confirm active malware execution.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **Execution**
  - Tactic: TA0002
  - Technique: User Execution (T1204.002)

- **Persistence**
  - Tactic: TA0003
  - Technique: Create or Modify System Process

---

## Pyramid of Pain Summary
- Hashes: Low impact on attacker
- IPs: Medium impact
- Domains: High impact
- TTPs: Very high impact
