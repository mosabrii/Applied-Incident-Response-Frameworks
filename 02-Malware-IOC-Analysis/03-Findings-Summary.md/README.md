# Findings Summary

## Investigation Outcome
The investigation confirmed that the analyzed file  
(SHA256: `54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b`)  
is **Confirmed Malicious**.

The file was identified as part of the **BlackTech (Palmerworm)** malware family, a
well-known and sophisticated threat targeting **financial sector organizations**.
Execution was verified on the endpoint, confirming this was an **active compromise**
rather than a theoretical risk.

---

## Key Findings

- Malware delivery occurred via a **phishing email attachment**
- Execution required **user interaction**, confirming social engineering usage
- Post-execution activity resulted in **unauthorized executable file creation**
- Behavioral analysis showed **persistent malicious activity**
- Community and vendor intelligence strongly corroborated malicious classification

---

## Identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

The investigation uncovered multiple **high-confidence IOCs** that require immediate blocking:

### File Hashes
- **SHA-256:** `54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b`
- **MD5:** `eb96d1d40807b55977a4563a6f9f38f1`
- **SHA-1:** `8090744036113b56947702f741584e0365773220`

### Network Infrastructure
- **Malicious IP Address:** `147.92.114.156`
- **Malicious Domain:** `clinic.plpms.com`

### Host-Based Indicators
- Creation of **unauthorized executable files** in temporary system directories
- Multiple abnormal process creation events detected by sandbox analysis

---

## Threat Behavior Analysis

Sandbox reports (including CAPE and Zenbox) confirmed that the malware:

- Executes immediately after the attachment is opened
- Attempts to establish **external C2 communication**
- Generates abnormal **HTTP, DNS, and IP traffic**
- Leaves behind multiple artifacts to maintain persistence

Observed behavior strongly aligns with **advanced malware operations** rather than commodity threats.

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping (TTPs)

The attacker’s techniques were mapped to the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:

- **TA0002 – Execution**  
  - *T1204.002 (User Execution)*  
    The malware relied on the victim opening a malicious email attachment.

- **TA0003 – Persistence**  
  - Creation of malicious artifacts to remain active on the compromised endpoint.

These techniques indicate a **targeted and deliberate attack chain**.

---

## Risk Assessment

- **Impact:** High  
  Full endpoint compromise with potential lateral movement inside a financial environment.

- **Likelihood:** Confirmed  
  Malware execution and persistence were directly observed during analysis.

Failure to contain this threat could result in further compromise across the network.

---

## Final Assessment

Based on verified execution, behavioral evidence, confirmed C2 infrastructure, and
MITRE ATT&CK alignment:

**This incident requires immediate containment, IOC blocking, and escalation.**

Recommended actions include endpoint isolation, blocking identified hashes, IPs,
and domains, and reinforcing phishing awareness controls.
